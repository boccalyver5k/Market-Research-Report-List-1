<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ischemic Heart Disease Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angina Pectoris</li><li>Myocardial Infarction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ischemic heart disease drugs market consists of treatments targeting two main conditions: angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. Angina pectoris, characterized by chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart, is managed with medications like nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers to alleviate symptoms. Myocardial infarction, or heart attack, requires more intensive interventions, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and thrombolytics to restore blood flow and prevent further damage to the heart muscle. Both segments drive market growth through ongoing innovations and increasing incidences of cardiovascular diseases.</p></p>
