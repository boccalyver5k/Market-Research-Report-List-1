<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Draft Cooling Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Draft Cooling Towers Spray</li><li>Natural Draft Cooling Towers Splash Deck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural draft cooling towers utilize ambient air to dissipate heat from industrial processes. The market comprises two main types: spray and splash deck cooling towers. Spray cooling towers distribute water droplets into the airflow, enhancing heat transfer efficiency. In contrast, splash deck cooling towers rely on water flowing over a series of surfaces, creating a larger surface area for air to contact, thus cooling the water indirectly. Both types are crucial for energy efficiency in power generation and industrial applications.</p></p>
