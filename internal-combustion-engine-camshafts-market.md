<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internal Combustion Engine Camshafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Overhead Camshaft (SOHC)</li><li>Double Overhead Camshaft (DOHC)</li><li>Overhead Valve (OHV) Camshafts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The internal combustion engine camshaft market features three primary types: Single Overhead Camshaft (SOHC), Double Overhead Camshaft (DOHC), and Overhead Valve (OHV) camshafts. SOHC designs utilize a single camshaft to operate both intake and exhaust valves, offering simplicity and cost-effectiveness. DOHC configurations use two camshafts for better airflow and engine performance, allowing for more precise valve timing. OHV camshafts are located in the engine block and use pushrods, providing compact designs but generally resulting in lower rpm performance compared to overhead setups.</p></p>
