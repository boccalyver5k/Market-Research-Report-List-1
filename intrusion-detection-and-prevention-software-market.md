<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IDS</li><li>IPS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software (IDPS) encompasses two main types: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). IDS monitors network or system activities for malicious actions and policy violations, alerting administrators to potential threats. In contrast, IPS not only detects but also actively prevents intrusions by blocking or rejecting harmful traffic. Together, both systems enhance cybersecurity by providing real-time threat identification and response, ensuring better protection against evolving cyber threats.</p></p>
